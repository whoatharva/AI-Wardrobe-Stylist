## 📁 Wardrobe JSON Format

Your wardrobe file should be an array of clothing/accessory objects, like:

```json
{
  "type": "top",
  "name": "white t-shirt",
  "season": ["Summer"],
  "occasion": ["Casual"],
  "color": "White",
  "style": "Western",
  "fabric": "Cotton"
}
```

Supports types like: `top`, `bottom`, `footwear`, `accessory`, `outerwear`.

## ✨ Roadmap Ideas

- ✨ Integration with user-uploaded images for virtual try-on
- 📦 Persistent wardrobe storage (login-based)
- 🔁 Outfit history and lookbook generation
- 🎤 Voice-controlled fashion assistant

---

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

- Make sure your DALL·E-style API supports `POST` requests with a prompt, image size, and returns a URL.
- This app randomly samples items for each outfit—perfect for prototyping, not for fashion police court.
